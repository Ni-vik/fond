College breaks are often thought of as a time to enjoy good food. Unfortunately, many students find 
themselves waiting in long queues at the canteen, which not only ruins their mood but also wastes their 
valuable time. Nobody wants to miss a lecture or eat their food in a rush.
What if we could save you the time you spend waiting in queues to place your order? 
What if you didn't have to wait for your food to be prepared, but instead it was ready and waiting for
you when you arrived? This may sound too good to be true, but it is now a reality with FonD.

FonD's business model operates as a mobile application that streamlines the ordering process for college students. 
The app allows students to place their orders in advance, bypassing the long queues commonly found in college 
canteens.

In order to get canteens and cafes to work with us, we will need to focus on the benefits that our app provides. 
We will emphasize that our app will save them time and increase their efficiency by reducing the time spent 
taking orders and preparing food. Additionally, we will highlight the convenience that our app provides to the
customers, which will attract more business to the canteens and cafes.

To attract our initial set of canteens and cafes, we will leverage our personal network of contacts in the food 
industry. We will also provide incentives such as lower commission rates and marketing assistance to early 
adopters. As we grow and gain more customers, we will expand our marketing efforts to reach more canteens and 
cafes in the area. Our goal is to establish ourselves as the go-to platform for online ordering in the college
campus market.
